Tryna determine shoot angle
---------------------------
D_a = Distance from camera at its angle to the AprilTag
theta = Angle that the AprilTag would "look down" at to the camera
A_h = Height of AprilTag
G_h = Height of Goal
d_1 = D_a * sin theta [method 1 of distance computation]
d_2 = sqrt (D_a)^2 - (A_h)^2 [method 2 of distance computation]
S_a = sin^-1 G_h / (sqrt d(1,2)^2 + G_h^2)
